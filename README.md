Project based on cab booking system
I alongwith my other four group members have done a project on Cab booking services named Hire A Cab. 
In this web app certain places are stored in the database along with their co-ordinates.
The number of cars at a specific location is also stored.Admin has the provision to add and delete a place from the database and also alter the number of cars at a specific location.
The passenger Will first have to log in in case he doesnâ€™t have an account it will ask the user to register first and then the user can log in.
After logging in the user will enter the source and destination and the web app will calculate the fair according to the coordinates of the source and destination.
If the car is not available at the source currently the app will display the appropriate message.After the booking is done by the user the app will generate a bill and the user will be redirected to the home screen.
